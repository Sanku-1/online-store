# Online Store

## Description of the Project

This application allows a user to view a list of products provided via csv, and add them to a shopping cart based on their selections for a final check out/purchase.

## User Stories
- As a business owner, I want to be able to input my product inventory, so that users can view what is for sale.
- As a user, I want to receive immediate feedback, so I can understand what to do next.
- As a customer, I want the shopping cart to show each unique item only once with its total quantity, so that I can easily see how many of each item Iâ€™m buying without the cart being cluttered with duplicates.
